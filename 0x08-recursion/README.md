Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem. In other words, a recursive function is a function that calls itself within its own definition.

When a function is called, the computer allocates memory space for that function call, including the function's input parameters and local variables. When a function calls itself recursively, the computer allocates additional memory space for each new function call, creating a new instance of the function to run independently. Each instance of the function has its own set of input parameters and local variables, allowing it to perform its own computations.

Recursive functions can be useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems that are similar in nature to the original problem. By using recursion, the function can solve the problem by solving smaller versions of the same problem, until it reaches a base case that can be solved without recursion.

However, it is important to use recursion carefully, as it can lead to stack overflow errors and consume a lot of memory if not implemented correctly.
